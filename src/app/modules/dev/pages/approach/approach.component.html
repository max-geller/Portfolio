<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Web Development environment changes very rapidly.</p>
<p>
  It's not really a linear experience. Different trends pinch developers to
  learn different things in different orders.
</p>
<p>
  I started in web development in 1999 (I was 12 years old) learning the basics
  HTML and CSS. When WordPress came out with PHP-driven templates in 2006, it
  was a natural fit.
</p>
<p>Computer Science</p>
<p>Web hosting</p>
<p>Graphic Design</p>
<p>SQL and relational data</p>
<p>
  Since that time, I've focused heavily on rounding out my knowledge with
  Javascript. Specifically, NodeJS has enabled moder full-stack web development
  using JavaScript.

<h2>Driving Concepts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Think First. And when you're done thinking, think some more. I tend to spend
    a long time thinking about the code I'm going to write. Mostly because I
    only want to write it once.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can absolutely learn web development and build something cool at the
    same time. So do it that wasy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make it fun for the developer. Developer hapiness and productivity will
    follow
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop your own 'workflow' and develop a robust ecosystem of personal
    libraries, components and starters.
  </li>
  <li>
    Aesthetics are everything. Technology should be playful and fun to use by
    the end user.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spend your time on the core tech. Unless you're just getting started
    learning how to code. If that's the case, don't start with the core tech. Do
    everything but the core tech. Save that $hit for last., but don't forget to
    start with
  </li>
  <li>Functional-first, OOP second</li>
  <li>Minimize read/writes</li>
  <li>Iterate... where it makes sense</li>
  <li>Go asynchronous</li>
  <li>Separation of concerns</li>
  <li>Document the $hit out of it</li>
  <li>Finish the task</li>
  <li>Don't repeat code</li>
  <li>Data should always be encrypted</li>
  <li>Data should be prepared for mining by ML/AI</li>
  <li>Understand Cloud Pricing Constraints</li>
  <li>Minimize bundle size</li>
  <li>Don't neglect testing</li>
  <li>Send it. Full Send.</li>
</ul>
